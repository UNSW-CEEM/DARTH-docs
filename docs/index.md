# Overview

## Introduction

Data resource time-series hub (DARTH) is a growing database system of the School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering (SPREE). It consists of a cloud-based database and a web interface to access and download the data, available to all UNSW members (anyone with a zID). Direct access to the database can be granted as well. Please see the **Access** section for details.  

This documentation will be further developed as the datasets grow and new ones are added, and in response to user feedback.

## Data Sources

The data in the DARTH database has two different types of sources:

### 1. Automatically Collected Data

There is photovoltaics and weather data that has been automatically collected from sensors on UNSW Sydney buildings, processed, and uploaded to the database. The data is stored in the following tables:

- **photovoltaics**  
- **metadatapv**  
- **metadataunitspv**  
- **units**  
- **versioninfo**  
- **weather**  
- **metadataunitsweather**

### 2. External Data Sources

Various datasets have been obtained from external sources, processed, and uploaded to the database. They include:

- Ausgrid 300 Homes Solar Data  
- Solar Analytics Solar Data  
- PV Bushfire Data  
- Victorian Consumers Data  
- EDP (Energy Data Platform)  
- BOM (weather data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology)
